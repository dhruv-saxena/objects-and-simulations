#Objects & Simulations

<canvas id="draw_canvas"></canvas>

###Keywords
object-oriented programming, graphical simulation, physics, behaviour modelling

##Introduction
This class investigates the use of software as ground for design observations, explorations and artistic expression. Using software one can formally describe objects and the types of relations these objects can have with each other and their environment. Simulations can be devised to perform such relational dynamics between objects and their environment. Emergent object-environment behaviours can thus be observed which would otherwise be impossible to even predict.

This course focuses on basic concepts and techniques of object oriented programming and graphical computer simulations, that is, it introduces ways in which object oriented modelling may be used to create performative contexts where complex graphical artefacts may emerge from.

Participants will have a chance to derive a practical “hands-on” understanding of computational and graphical programming with an emphasis on object and behaviour modelling.

##Content
Five areas of exploration will be covered during this course:  (1) Object-Oriented Programming, (2) Affine Transformation, (3) Oscillations, (4) Physics Simulation, and (5) (Basic) Behaviour Modelling. 

Each area is composed of various small exercises where participants are expected to program computational artefacts reflecting their learning as they go along. Participants will be presented various ways of quickly and easily composing programs incorporating a mix of the above subjects, leading them to conceptualise and implement a final exploration of their own.

This course not only focuses on tools, but on how these tools can become a part of the ways participants work and think, enabling them to prototype, experiment and explore emerging ideas more quickly and more effectively using software.

##Learnings Expectations
__Discourse:__

- develop an appreciation of the field of generative design.  
- develop a critical view of software in regards to design practices.  
- acquire basic programming and graphical vocabulary to be used in future research work.  

__Skills:__

- learn how to fast prototype software-based graphical and interactive designs.
- learn how to develop expressive and interactive graphical artefacts and representations.
- learn how to develop social interactions using software.

##Evaluation Criteria
__Evaluation Criteria (course)__

The course will be a success if ...

- the students are challenged and successful in designing software based graphical prototypes.  
- the mini-exercises assist students in the fabrication of presentable working prototypes.  
- the final piece is explored, tested and critiqued for future development.  

__Evaluation Criteria (students)__

On which basis will the students and their work be evaluated?

- development: how much the student's understanding of the field increases over the course of the workshop.  
- collaboration: how much effort did the student invest into sharing skill sets and acquired knowledge with others.  
- commitment: how much energy did the student invest over the course of the workshop.
