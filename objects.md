### Object Oriented Programming I: Class and Objects

#### A. [OO-NotePad](img/OO-NotePad.pdf)

Using the _OO-NotePad_ sheet, observe four (4) objects in your surrounding and formally describe them usign the following descriptors:

1. Name of the object
2. Visual diagram / representation
3. List of Attributes
	+ Static -- an attribute that does not change (much) over time
	+ Dynamic -- an attribute that changes aspect over time

Questions:

1. Is there an atribute that is common to all (or some) of your objects?
2. Do you see any familiarity between your objects?
3. Is there any hierarchical realtionship(s) that could be devise between your objects?

#### B. OO Modeling

Following your OO obervations, formalise your (paper) descriptions using the **U**nified **M**odeling **L**anguage (UML)
